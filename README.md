## Details

Gazetteer is a interactive mapping web application, utilising the Leaflet.js library to display map tiles and interact with the app.
The purpose of application is for users to explore the countries of the world, fetch data about each country and compare said data in an organised interface.
Available data is roughly cataegoried into the following Tabs:
- **Wiki**: A short snippet from Wikipedia, with a link to the full page should the user wish to read further in a new browser tab, as well as Capital city and other major cities with their respective populations.
- **Weather**: The Capital's Current weather status, a 24-hour Hourly forecast, as well as a 7-day Daily forecast. Data can include Cloud & UV index status, temperature, rain amount / probability, wind speed / direction, & more.
- **Financial**: The major currencies commonly used in the Country, as well as current and historic exchange rates displayed on a candlestick chart utiling the Chart.js library. GDP is also displayed as a gross amount, as well as on a per-capita basis.
- **People**: General data about the population - including age, population density, urban dwelling distributions and migration.

## Technology

- Mobile-first Progressive Web Application **(PWA)** that behaves like a native application when added to mobile devices' home screen (Android / iOS).
- **MySQL** database to hold own dataset, cache external API data, track map tile caching statuses, as well as track user usage to rate-limit where applicable.
- **PHP** to interact with internal DB and external APIs.
- Exchange rate data regularly polled and cached using **crontab**, then daily collated into a separate table for historical figures (e.g. open/close/max/min).
- Data cached to Local Storage via **HTML5 Web Storeage API** to ease reload times and traffic on the web server.
- Map tiles are loaded directly from free unlimited-use providers where possible, with a select few (e.g. weather overlays) that require a developer API key and limited usage going via the app's web server first to keep track of usage amount and **rate-limit** when necessary.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis** undertaken on certain datapoints to generate breakpoints to be used in data visualisation "sliders" in the UI to help users get context on what the data for each Country means relative to each other.
- Country outlines initially loaded from a small/minimal geoJson file in order to generate polylines to capture user hovers/clicks, but once a Country has been loaded, larger/high resolution Country geoJson outlines are loaded from parsed separate files that can easily be retrieved as-and-when the user needs them (then cached), which aims to balance a **swift initial loading time** of the underlying app, but also pleasing **detailed outlines on demand**.
- The Country Search Bar checks the user's input for any matches to present in the dropdown to select from (using **Twitter's Typeahead.js**). Also as a fallback if no direct match is found (in the case of typos for example) the app uses an algorithm based on "**Levenshtein distance**" to return what it think is the closest match.
- Data is fetched **asynchronously** using **AJAX** and then parsed to be displayed on-screen utilising **jQuery** to perform DOM manipulation.
